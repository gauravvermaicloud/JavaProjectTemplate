 * This is a MySQL Specific entity to manage user role mapping.
 * It should be noted that user id and role id are not mapped to the
 * specific user role because we do not want the lazy binding to be employed this is
 * because this information will be used either while creating a mapping or while
 * filling the user while login. When it comes to role id's they will be managed using cache
 * for performance and user id is not taken because this will cause to many seek's
