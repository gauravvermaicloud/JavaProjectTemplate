/** 
 * This class implements user metadata. The reason it is implemented as an 
 * internal class is due to the nature of DB implementation. Ideally we
 * want to expose this information as a map, however given we have
 * made choice of MySql with additional fields of id and UserId in a seperate join table
 * along with Hibernate such implementation is not trivial, but this implementation
 * is specific to MySQL Users only, hence we implement this class.
 * 
 * I am not sure if this is a bad design or an anti pattern as I implement this, 
 * and this should be reviewed from both design perspective and code.
 * 
 * There is also a further possibility that I am not aware of doing this work
 * with some clever mapping in hibernate and removing the need if any for this
 * kind of mapping.
 * 
 * An alternate implementation could have been saving all this information as a JSON
 * in User table but this was not done (while we did it in case of Session) was because
 * we expect this to grow and be used in reports. 
 * 
 * Metadata is expected to be used in things like address etc which was not put in user table
 * unless someone wants to make them first class citizens and extend the existing user model.
